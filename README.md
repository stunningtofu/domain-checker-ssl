Create a file like https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ with a shell script

To run a file with cron, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and type `crontab -e` to edit your cron jobs.
2. Add a new line to the file with the following format:
    ```
    * * * * * /path/to/your/file.sh
    ```
    Replace `/path/to/your/file.sh` with the actual path to your file.
3. Save the file and exit the editor.

This will schedule your file to run every minute. You can customize the timing by modifying the `* * * * *` part of the line. For example, to run the file every hour, you can use `0 * * * *`.

Remember to make your file executable by running `chmod +x /path/to/your/file.sh` before adding it to cron.
